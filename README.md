# hello-world
just learning 


 Hi Everyone,
 
  I am on here to help with my learning experience in coding. 
  I hope to help others with projects as well
  I also hope to get help with projects of my own.
  I am currently a product engineer at a high temperature wire company.
  Some of my projects are to help me learn something new and exciting as well as help me with some projects at work i am involved with.
